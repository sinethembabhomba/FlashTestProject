You are working for a start up company which would like to provide an additional piece of  functionality to their clients. The definition of this service would be to “bloop” out sensitive words of  the company’s choice, on their chat system i.e., SQL sensitive words, profanity, or anything the  company deems “Sensitive”. As an example, we have chosen our words to be in line with SQL key  words. An example of this would be “SELECT” or “DROP” but could be any other word on the  companies Sensitive list.
